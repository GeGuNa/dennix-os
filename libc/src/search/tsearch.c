/*
Our binary search tree is implemented as a left-leaning red-black tree [1].
In between operations that change the tree, the following invariants hold:
1. A red node has only black children.
2. Any path from the root to any leaf crosses the same number of baclk nodes.
3. A black node can have at most one red child and this child (if it exists) is
   always the left one.

During operations that change the tree these invariants may temporarily be
violated but these violations will always be fixed before returning.
