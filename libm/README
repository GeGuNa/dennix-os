The files in this directory implement the math library (libm). The code was
taken from musl libc (https://www.musl-libc.org/) and updated to be used in
Dennix. It is licensed under the MIT license compatible to the ISC license used
by Dennix. Some code is licensed under other permissive terms as noted in the
individual files.

The current version is based on commit d91a6cf6e369a79587c5665fce9635e5634ca201
of musl.

The math library is not built as a separate libm.a libary but is built is part
of libc. An empty libm.a file is installed so that programs that try to link
with libm will work.
