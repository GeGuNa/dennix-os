The files in this directory implement the math library (libm). The code was
taken from musl libc (https://www.musl-libc.org/) and updated to be used in
Dennix. It is licensed under the MIT license compatible to the ISC license used
by Dennix. Some code is licensed under other permissive terms as noted in the
individual files.

The current version is based on commit f5eee489f7662b08ad1bba4b1267e34eb9565bba
of musl.

The math library is not built as a separate libm.a libary but is built is part
of libc. An empty libm.a file is installed so that programs that try to link
with libm will work.
